Dreams do come true
---
I am incredibly excited to announce that I will be joining the amazing team behind the creation of **Flesh and Blood**, the game that we have all quickly fallen in love with, at **Legend Story Studios**!!!

I will be operating under the role of **Business Development Manager** with the primary duty of bringing **Flesh and Blood** into as many countries and territories possible. This is seriously a **dream come true** and I’m very honoured to have the opportunity to spread the joy that is **Flesh and Blood** to the wider reaches of the world.

Going forward, I will be **relinquishing any claim or opportunity** to compete in further high-level events such as **The Calling series, Nationals, and the World Championship, etc**. Reaching the **number one rank** in the first season of organised play has been an amazing journey that I will always remember fondly. **Great** people, places, stories, and games. Thank you, **everyone**, who contributed to these events.

I truly believe that we are all witnesses and apart of the beginning of something that is **special** and that is here for the **long haul**.

I can’t wait to see and share what greatness this game has in store **next!**

Herein lies a unique opportunity where I am able to speak freely of **any and all** strategic knowledge that I have accumulated during this initial period of competitive gameplay before my brain goes under lock-and-key with the confidentiality of employment and trade secrets.

I will be accepting submissions of any question that is **Flesh and Blood** related (or otherwise interesting) and honestly and unabashedly answering as much as I can within an hour or so at the **conclusion of this week**.

What is in your opinion the best class? Why wasn’t the Spaghetti Tornado deck named Ninja Turtle instead? When will **Luke Badger** return to dominance? The opportunities for discussion are endless!

Please feel free to submit your questions **[HERE][google-form]**

I’m very much looking forward to seeing what you all ask :)
